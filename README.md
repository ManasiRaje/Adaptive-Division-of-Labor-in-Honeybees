# Adaptive-Division-of-Labor-in-Honeybees
Animats-Based Modeling 

Adaptive division of labor is one key characteristic of eusocial insect colonies and of high relevance in biology, ethology, swarm intelligence and robotics. My goal was an accurate model of a heterogeneous environment and flow of nutrients within the colony. Animats in this project will primarily focus on foraging and storing using adaptive division of labor and task partitioning. The animats will decide which task to choose, depending on the intensity of stimuli and on individual thresholds, which are modulated in response to task performance. Animats closely follow the behavior of adult honey bees in their colonies.

Hypothesis

The model should reach an equilibrium after a limited amount of time given appropriate initial starting conditions, where the number of each type of bee does not waver above a tolerance level. The model should also recover and attain equilibrium when perturbations are introduced such as sudden loss of a particular type of animat.

Goals

1.	Animats should act in specific behavior depending on their type and task
2.	The model should actively allocate tasks to the animats so as to optimize time and effort
